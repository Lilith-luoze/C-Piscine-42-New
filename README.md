# Swim-for-exam
I have collected my piscine projects AND all of the subject files for **my piscine 2025-May**. The correctness record is attached.

I recommend an ideal working flow of doing the basics of each projects but don't submit them until you can do the last one. It's ideal because the last ones are hard but they can be very important if you want to achieve higher than 80 in the final exam. And this flow would save you some time if you are doing piscine part-time like me.

Good luck and try not to drown! :)
